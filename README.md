## Introduction
  The Service Area API allows clients to manage providers and their associated service areas, as well as to search for service areas that include a specific geographic location. This documentation outlines the available endpoints, their usage, and examples to help you integrate with the API effectively.

## Base URL 
  http://<your-domain-or-ip>:8000
  Replace <your-domain-or-ip> with the actual domain or IP address where your API is hosted.
